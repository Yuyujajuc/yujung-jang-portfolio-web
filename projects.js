    description: `This is a lyric video of Pink Floyd's song \"Comfortably Numb\". 
    Some words in the lyrics are replaced by important symbols in the animation. 
    For example, the word \"you\" is replaced by a dark butterfly and \"I\" 
    is replaced by a T-pin. \"I\" and the pin has a graphic relation, and \"I\"
    and \"you\" have a narrative relation; a contradiction. I was inspired by 
    butterfly taxidermy in RISD's Nature Lab. 
    
    \n I associate the process of a caterpillar 
    metamorphosing into a butterfly to a creative process. A caterpillar builds a cocoon 
    and crawls in while, inside the private room, its organs and biological structures 
    completely transforms. When it is ready it breaks the cozy cocoon to reveal itself 
    to the scary, vast nature. I used metamorphosis as a metaphor for a small thought or 
    a line in a sketchbook turning into a big project. A creative process almost always 
    comes with frustration. I associate the sense of stagnation and anxiety caused from 
    approaching deadlines with the displayed butterflies and caterpillars in the taxidermy box.`,

    description: `This Place Is A Lot looks at the irony of non-vehicular interactions that 
    occur in a space designed for vehicles. We want to view the Metropark parking 
    lot as a site for more than what it is intended for. We observed traffic in ways 
    unrelated to cars: animals, pedestrians, flora, and light patterns. It was 
    interesting to view an unextraordinary space like a parking lot as one filled 
    with much more life than initially observed.

    \n This display is a mockup of a web experience intended to guide the viewer through 
    an abstracted space, "the place" later understood as a parking lot. On this journey, 
    the user encounters a range of residents and passersby of the place, prompted to click 
    on each and obtain data on their whereabouts, personalities, and movement.`,

I started with a sketch of a face divided by two windows. I wanted the interaction between two 
posters feel personal. I considered drawing all faces I collected to unify the shape and tone, 
but eventually I decided that the colors and even expressions of the creative makeup looks give 
life to the posters. I did a physical collage to feel the dimensions of the final posters. 
Finding on the title font was a challenge because I wanted the title to capture the essence of 
the word 'makeup'. I did an illustrative lettering to express the essence of makeup.`,
